# My-PortFolio
I have created a dynamic portfolio using Angular, where I utilized Angular CLI for efficient project management. The front-end development was done using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript, providing a seamless user experience. The integration of Angular Material further enhanced the User Interface, effectively showcasing my professional journey.
